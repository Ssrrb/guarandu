Project Setup Overview:

    Button Variants:
    We've added buttons in the button.tsx file using shadcn/ui. The /buttons page is used to preview and test the various button styles and options available in the system.

    Main Layout & Hero Section:
    The main layout and hero section are defined in the (marketing) page. This serves as the core visual and structural foundation for our public-facing content.

    Authentication with Clerk:
    Clerk has been integrated into the project. Middleware was configured in middleware.ts and the appropriate Clerk setup was added to the root ./layout.tsx file to ensure authentication is properly handled throughout the app.
